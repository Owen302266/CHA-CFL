# CHA-CFL

This repository is part of the source code for  paper(currently early access version):

â€‹	[Class Hierarchy Aware Contrastive Feature Learning for Multi-Granularity SAR Target Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582307). 



The code is conducted under official PyTorch library, and pre-trained models are available for CHA-CFL. Hoping it's helpful!

## Update

*Due to the requirements of PLA, currently we only open-source the pre-trained models. We will open source the overall model as soon as it's available.*

- 2024-07-07: update the testing code.
- TODO: upload the pre-trained models.

## Introduction

![alt text](figures/framework.png)

To fully explore the label distribution of images, we use CHA-CFL to find the hierarchical similarity in categories. The source code of Multi-view Feature Extractor is included in this repository.

## Get Started

The key environment we use are as below:

- GPU: 2070 Super
- CUDA: 12.1
- PyTorch: 1.13.0
- Numpy: 1.26.3
  

We provide both python file and jupyter notebook file for testing. When running the code, only sampling_rate variable is needed to change within[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. 


## Pretrained Models
